I've been making a detective game in Unity, where the player searches for
clues. Instead of just highlighting what's important, I want to give
descriptions for most of the objects in a location and then the player can
decide what's important.

The video shows an early prototype that demonstrates my idea for how this
would work. I'm currently using Unity 2017, and I used 
[AssetForge](http://assetforge.io/) to make the room, and I used this
[furniture kit](http://kenney.nl/assets/furniture-kit) from Kenney.

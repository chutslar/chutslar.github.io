After learning about the excellent [learnopengl tutorials](https://learnopengl.com), I decided
to try making a 2D game engine using OpenGL for graphics and SDL2 for window management and input. 
Initially I was mostly messing around, but I've added a few cool things like a (simplistic) entity-component-system,
so I created a repo for my work on it [here](https://github.com/chutslar/SDL-OpenGL-Engine-Test). I plan on improving
the documentation and commenting, and then hopefully making a small demo game.

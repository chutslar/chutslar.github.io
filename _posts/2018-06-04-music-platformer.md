I recently started working on an idea I had a while ago for a puzzle platformer where the player is controlled by
playing musical notes to move. I started working on it a couple days ago and decided:

1) to develop for mobile since it makes sense for playing notes on a keyboard

2) to open-source the code under GPLv3.0 so that in the future other people might be able to use the code as a resource

The repo is [here](https://github.com/chutslar/Mobile-Music-Platformer).
There are currently four levels, and I am working on more; but the core mechanics are present already.
